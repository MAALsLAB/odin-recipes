          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            When we talk about the greatest fried chicken recipes of all time,
            karaage has to be at or near the top of that list. This
            Japanese-style fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely
            flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the fact
            that there is no skin or bones involved. However, not all karaage
            recipes are created equal, and the awesomeness is very much
            dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, that's pure potato starch. While I'm not known for my
            extensive, and exhaustive, recipe testing, I did many, many tests
            and experiments, using pretty much every possible combination of
            starch options; wheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, et al., and
            potato starch was the winner. By the way, do not accidently buy
            potato flour, which is not the same thing, and will not work the
            same. If you can't find potato starch, which you can, I think
            cornstarch is the next best option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above and beyond the coating starch, the marinade also varies from
            recipe to recipe, but most contain what I've used here, give or take
            a splash of mirin, and you shouldn't hesitate to experiment with
            different ratios. No matter what you use, I think a 2-3 hours
            marinade is perfect, but like I said in the video, anywhere from 1
            to 10 hours is considered appropriate. No matter how long your soak,
            I hope you find some potato starch, and give this incredible fried
            chicken a try soon. Enjoy!

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 1</strong>
              <p>
                Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black
                pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 2</strong>
              <p>
                Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly and
                evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 3</strong>
              <p>
                Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a
                foil-lined baking sheet. Add potato starch to a wide, shallow
                bowl.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 4</strong>
              <p>
                Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with
                marinade. Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch
                until evenly coated. Shake off any excess starch and place
                chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 5</strong>
              <p>
                Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of
                starch, then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to
                the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 6</strong>
              <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 7</strong>
              <p>
                Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in
                batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the
                outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a
                paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.
